1) Make a data folder inside it make 2 folders
   i) Happy: Add img of happy people
   ii) Sad: Add img of sad people

2) Make an Conda environment.
3) Now attach this environment in **ImageClassification.ipynb**
4) Open and run **ImageClassification.ipynb** 

**About:**
Task: Classify Happy (i.e. 0) or Sad (i.e. 1) 
Iâ€™ve built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model architecture includes:
Input Layer: Image shape (256, 256, 3)
Convolutional Layers: Conv2D layers with Relu activation
MaxPooling Layers: pool_size=(2, 2)
Flatten Layer
Dense Layers
